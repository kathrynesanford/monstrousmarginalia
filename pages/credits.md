### *Monstrous Marginalia*

*Monstrous Marginalia* was created by [Kathryn Sanford](https://kathrynesanford.github.io), an English PhD Student at the University of Miami, as her capstone project for the Spring 2023 Digital Humanities Practicum (MLL 744/ENG 613). Her professor for this course was [Professor Susanna Allés-Torrent](https://susannalles.com/), to whom she would like to offer a great deal of thanks for her patience and support.

### Collection Items

The collection items in *Monstrous Marginalia* were sourced from the [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/welcome.htm) and the [Bodleian Library's](https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/collections/western-medieval-manuscripts/) digital collections of medieval manuscripts. *Monstrous Marginalia* was constructed bearing in mind the terms of reuse delineated by both the [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/reuse.asp) and the [Bodleian Library](https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/terms/). The British Library's *Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts* was kindly made available under a [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
