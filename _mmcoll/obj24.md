marginalia_description: A bottom-of-the-page detail of two grotesque hybrids playing
  musical instruments. The hybrid on the left, whose body is entirely animalistic,
  appears to be playing a triangle. The hybrid on the right, who has a human head
  and torso, but the bottom half of a bird, plays a fiddle.
