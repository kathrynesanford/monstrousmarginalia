  figure. This drawing, as well as the drawing of the figure with a staff above it,
  are later additions to the manuscript. The manuscript itself is dated to the end
  of the 14th century, authored by a Walter Hilton, but the drawings were added in
  the first half of the 15th century by an unknown artist.
